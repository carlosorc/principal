<h2>Expectation:</h2>

<pre>I would like to learn how to use all the machine that we are going to put in our ¨FabLab" in Santander. But the most important for me is to be able to help people here to get de knowledge to take advantage of resources and create the community to reuse all the products that they think are garbage or if for them are garbage to share with other people who can reuse them.</pre>
