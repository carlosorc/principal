<h1>Carlos Orcajo Bustamante. Champion Santander</h1>
<h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>I was born in 1986 in Santander.</p>

<p>I studied Civil Engineering at the University of Cantabria untill 2011 and while I was studying I worked for 3 months in a tunnel. After that I worked as a new technologies teacher for 6 months and then I went to Vienna to an Architectural Studio. After that I came back to Santander and I worked as a bicycle mechanic untill I get my actual job as Telecentros coordinator of Santander Municipality.</p>
   
<p>When I was a child I loved taking pieces of radiocontrol cars or other types of toys like engines and building with theme another gadgets.</p>

<p>Nowadays I use to mount solar panels in motorhomes or vans, iluminations systems, electric chargers and that kind of things that make live better in that vehicles.</p>

<h2>Expectation:</h2>
<p>I would like to learn how to use all the machine that we are going to put in our ¨FabLab" in Santander. But the most important for me is to be able to help people here to get the knowledge to take advantage of resources and create the community to reuse all the products that they think are garbage or if for them are garbage to share with other people who can reuse them.
</p>

<h2>Activity 2: Weekly Assignment - Design a logo for your Circular Maker Space</h2>
<p>I decided to use a mobile app to do the first design. I thought it was better because I could change details and concepts everywhere I was and then I could draw the definitive logo on the PC. I have used Canva app, It is very ease to put simple element and text to compound a logo and it is free in the initial version.
</p> 
<p>My logo is a representation of the sea of Santander, a kind of container and a mechanism. I want to represent the makers thinking of building for recycling and caring for the environement, the sea in this case.</p>

<h2>Activity 3: Weekly Assignment - Moulding and Casting</h2>
<p>First of all I repeat the practice with Algar and Gelatine because during the sesion I was a disaster with mesures. I get a very good mould of a 3d printed keyring but I burned the chocolate so It wasn´t as good as I´d like. With gelatine I get the shape of cross of ice cube mould but it was very difficoult to extract them in one piece. </p>

<p>I make a 2 sides mould using again the mixure of water, algar and milk and I cast a RAM motorbike support. I thougth this piece was a very good one to cast with a 2 pieces mould because it has a esferic part and a cilinder part. I used chocolate again but this time with some milk to be able to inject the chocolate trhow a small hole.</p>
<p>I have learnt that we can use a lot of cheap materials to try prototypes and ways of fabrications at the begining and then we can try with more expensive and more difficult prototypes. I have learnt how to do a 2 pieces mould; I though yo have to put the piece and to cover it with the product just to the middle but I realise that you have to use clay to cover half piece or if the material is cheap maybe you can cover all the piece, cut de material and then cover the piece again. Another important step is to mesure all de component and the volume of the piece because in the last step if you don´t know the volume you can inject too much material and open the 2 pieces mold. I thing is a very good experiment to learn how making pieces works in real life. </p>
