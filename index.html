<h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>I was born in 1986 in Santander.</p>

<p>I studied Civil Engineering at the University of Cantabria untill 2011 and while I was studying I worked for 3 months in a tunnel. After that I worked as a new technologies teacher for 6 months and then I went to Vienna to an Architectural Studio. After that I came back to Santander and I worked as a bicycle mechanic untill I get my actual job as Telecentros coordinator of Santander Municipality.</p>

<h2>Expectation:</h2>
<p>I would like to learn how to use all the machine that we are going to put in our ¨FabLab" in Santander. But the most important for me is to be able to help people here to get the knowledge to take advantage of resources and create the community to reuse all the products that they think are garbage or if for them are garbage to share with other people who can reuse them.
