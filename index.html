<h1>Carlos Orcajo Bustamante. Champion Santander</h1>
<h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>I was born in 1986 in Santander.</p>

<p>I studied Civil Engineering at the University of Cantabria untill 2011 and while I was studying I worked for 3 months in a tunnel. After that I worked as a new technologies teacher for 6 months and then I went to Vienna to an Architectural Studio. After that I came back to Santander and I worked as a bicycle mechanic untill I get my actual job as Telecentros coordinator of Santander Municipality.</p>
   
<p>When I was a child I loved taking pieces of radiocontrol cars or other types of toys like engines and building with theme another gadgets.</p>

<p>Nowadays I use to mount solar panels in motorhomes or vans, iluminations systems, electric chargers and that kind of things that make live better in that vehicles.</p>

<h2>Expectation:</h2>
<p>I would like to learn how to use all the machine that we are going to put in our ¨FabLab" in Santander. But the most important for me is to be able to help people here to get the knowledge to take advantage of resources and create the community to reuse all the products that they think are garbage or if for them are garbage to share with other people who can reuse them.
</p>

<h2>Activity 2: Weekly Assignment - Design a logo for your Circular Maker Space</h2>
<p>I decided to use a mobile app to do the first design. I thought it was better because I could change details and concepts everywhere I was and then I could draw the definitive logo on the PC. I have used Canva app, It is very ease to put simple element and text to compound a logo and it is free in the initial version.
</p> 
<p>My logo is a representation of the sea of Santander, a kind of container and a mechanism. I want to represent the makers thinking of building for recycling and caring for the environement, the sea in this case.</p>
